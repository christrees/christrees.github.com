### CAT9, LLC expanded detail

#### Research and Development ASIC Forge.
ASIC Forge is technology service startup for data center ASIC miner deployments.  The founder and CEO is [John Michael Jepson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-michael-jepson-17a9a9a5/).  John and I worked together on the [Grundy Center Electric Co-Op Building](https://miningstore.com/case-study/biostar-solar-farm-bitcave-4-2/) Deployment for [The Mining Store](https://miningstore.com/).  I am working with John and his team to establish operational monitoring, maintainace and repair of ASIC miners running ARM embedded server boards.  The goal of ASIC Forge is to provide ASIC fleet managers with onsite service and SLA metrics that demonstrate tangible ROI.  

#### Researching AI learning feedback methods.
[Ralph Aceves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-aceves-b1a397/) started a new company [Hackerstrike](https://hackerstrike.com/).  I hosted the development server clusters and assisted the CTO with technology and deployment architectures.  Early public templates are availible on [http://hs.2cld.net/](http://hs.2cld.net/).  When woring with startups,  I provide general technology selection and configuration suggestions through open web documents.  

#### Researching deployment for Blender grid rendering using Bare Metal infrastructure.

#### Researching SDN, SDS and CI/CD methods for Bare Metal infrastructure. 
[Digital Rebar](https://rackn.com/rebar/) from [Rackn](https://rackn.com) Chief Solutions Architect [Shane Gibson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sygibson/) founder and CEO [Rob Hirschfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhirschfeld/)  

#### Researching automated infrastructure deployment and USDA broadband efforts for small rural communities. 
In reality, the efforts with various state and federal investments have never really been with the time.  But like this resume project effort, it has core documentational processes I feel are fundamental to successful practices.

#### Researching building Blockchain foundations for Edge Communities. 
[Grundy Center Electric Co-Op Building](https://miningstore.com/case-study/biostar-solar-farm-bitcave-4-2/) Deployment for [The Mining Store](https://miningstore.com/).  My personal test site for progress [melrose site - test.cat9.com](https://test.cat9.com/)

#### Researching who I should work with next.
