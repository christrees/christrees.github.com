### CAT9, LLC - the expanded detail...
If you don't get the "In a Place, out in Space", don't worry most don't.  It comes from [Kinks - In a space](https://youtu.be/dJsVsFcIee0?t=17).  If your concerned I would put a reference to a song in my resume, "I am not the Jedi you are looking for"... so move along cause this space is occupied.  ANYWAY...

Historically, **CAT Services** is my default consulting and startup entity.  **CAT9, LLC** and the associated domain [https://www.cat9.com/](https://www.cat9.com/) is an Iowa based LLC business container for all my edge network technology efforts.  CAT9 was created to move and maintain compute intellegence onto an autonomous edge network.  A smart edge for the network of things frontier.  The following is expanded detail for consulting research projects.

#### Research and Development ASIC Forge.
ASIC Forge is a technology service startup for data center ASIC miner deployments.  The founder and CEO is [John Michael Jepson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-michael-jepson-17a9a9a5/).  John and I worked together on the [Grundy Center Electric Co-Op Building](https://miningstore.com/case-study/biostar-solar-farm-bitcave-4-2/) Deployment for [The Mining Store](https://miningstore.com/).  I am working with John and his team to establish operational monitoring, maintainace and repair of ASIC miners running ARM embedded server boards.  The goal of ASIC Forge is to provide ASIC fleet managers with onsite service and SLA metrics that demonstrate tangible ROI.  

#### Researching AI learning feedback methods.
[Ralph Aceves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ralph-aceves-b1a397/) started a new company [Hackerstrike](https://hackerstrike.com/).  I hosted the development server clusters and assisted the CTO with technology and deployment architectures.  Early public templates are availible on [http://hs.2cld.net/](http://hs.2cld.net/).  When woring with startups,  I provide general technology selection and configuration suggestions through open web documents.  As Hackerstrike demand grows, we intend to use CAT9 methods for data center management and client automation.

#### Researching deployment for Blender grid rendering using Bare Metal infrastructure.
My relationship with [Grasshorse Animation Studios](https://grasshorse.com/) and the founder / CTO [Steve Jennings](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steve-jennings-8288b7b/) is over 10 years old.

#### Researching SDN, SDS and CI/CD methods for Bare Metal infrastructure. 
[DRP by Digital Rebar](https://rackn.com/rebar/) from [Rackn](https://rackn.com) Chief Solutions Architect [Shane Gibson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sygibson/) founder and CEO [Rob Hirschfeld](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rhirschfeld/)

To learn [DRP by Digital Rebar](https://rackn.com/rebar/) I started an automatic UX test of the DRP webapp using Cucumber and Selenium to access webdriver.

#### Researching automated infrastructure deployment and USDA broadband efforts for small rural communities. 
In reality, the efforts with various state and federal investments have a low probablity of success.  But like a resume, the grant documentational processes may expose an oppertunity hidden behind problems the grants are intended to fund.  

#### Researching building Blockchain foundations for Edge Communities. 
Due to my relationship with multiple rual community power and telecom utility providers, I was contacted to assist with the [Grundy Center Electric Co-Op Building](https://miningstore.com/case-study/biostar-solar-farm-bitcave-4-2/) Deployment for [The Mining Store](https://miningstore.com/).  My personal record for progress is at [melrose site - test.cat9.com](https://test.cat9.com/).  This was a younger team being creative and moving fast.  I ended up getting more involved in the core operational planning as they bumped into various difficulties along the way.  I have experience with high energy systems, networking and agricultural construction.  May seem like a funny combination but it was a good combination for the Melrose site.  Some of the guidance information is contained on a site I maintain at [http://aur.2cld.net/docs/](http://aur.2cld.net/docs/).

#### Researching who I should work with next.
