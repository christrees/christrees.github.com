# YouTube resume for Chris Trees

I'm not a fan of the traditional resume and interview process.  I am a big fan of documentation followed by user feedback.  So, I am attempting to combine a chore I dred with a process welcome.  Meet the Resume project.

The best traditional work history information about myself is on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/).   So, for this project we will use the PDF generated by clicking the More... button then "Save as PDF" on [Linkedin - Chris Trees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/).  Below is the output of the "Save as PDF" process on the [Linkedin - Chris Trees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/) page.
