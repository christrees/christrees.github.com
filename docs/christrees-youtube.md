# YouTube resume for Chris Trees

I'm not a fan of the traditional resume and interview process.  I am a big fan of documentation followed by user feedback.  So, I will combine a chore I dred with a process welcome.  Meet the Resume GitHub project with subject based YouTube interviews.

The best traditional work history information about myself is on [https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/).   So, for this project we will use the PDF generated by clicking the More... button then "Save as PDF" on [Linkedin - Chris Trees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/).  Below is the output of the "Save as PDF" process on the [Linkedin - Chris Trees](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christrees/) page.

## CAT Services / Croft Utility Partners
Consultant / Founder
Cedar Fall, IA 50613

### March 2009 - April 2011 (2 years 2 months)
Croft Utility Partners ( http://croftutilitypartners.com/ ) leverages and extends
unique infrastructure and usage patterns of each community to reduce reliance
on external commodities, encourage development of localized resources
and facilitate sales of excess capacity within the network. The Croft concept
was born out of the desire to serve technology to small rural communities in
a locally relevant, economically maintainable and socially acceptable way.
These efforts lead us to integration of power, water, sewer and emergency
communications systems.

## Pantera Systems
Founder and Architect
### January 2002 - December 2002 (1 year)
Based on extending the idea of distributed grid computing, Pantera attempted
to build a distributed storage and compute engine for accelerated batch
processing. The grid matrix was used to distribute both storage, data base
and compute algorithms across traditional servers. Matrix reduce was then
used along with the storage index to keep working data within the various
cache systems increasing the overall processing speed.

## Monggo
Systems Design

## January 2000 - March 2001 (1 year 3 months)
Monggo (changed name to Levient) developed one of the first remote desktop

deployed into multiple data centers. Developed automation for UI testing.
Developed automation for network health monitoring. Integrated network
monitoring into vendor Network Operations Centers (NOC).

## Vertical Networks

engineering talent.

## Rapid City Communications
CAT Services
### April 1996 - February 1997 (11 months)
Another great group of people! Got to help them build another high-speeddensity backplane. Worked with some great S/W guys that really pushed into
simulations that worked with the H/W Dev guys... Wish I could have helped
them slam out some ASIC's, but had too many people asking for my time and
had to multi-plex.

## SkyStream

### September 1994 - July 1995 (11 months)
Great people to work with and I meet many people who've become part of my
lifelong tribe. If only they would have built the mock-up that AndyH carried
in his pocket... or what AndyH put on the TV. I worked mainly keeping the
partner development systems running. I did the mechanical and umbilical
demo system for what I think was the first touch based magic cell phone
prototype. BTW that is STILL my personal phone, I would LOVE to get it back
(if anyone knows where it is)... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Magic


## Hughes

helped me gain a sense of balance with various design domain issues. https://

Great idea. Still ahead of it's time. Outsource your engineering. Reworked
development system via wire-wrap boards for "Little Blue". Little Blue (became
PC Transporter) was a co-processor board for the Apple II that allowed
the user to run IBM PC native software and use Apple II devices as native
IBM devices. Many ideas were ahead of the times, such as clone BIOS,
virtualization, distributed callbacks and storage normalization. The fun part
was getting to know a LOT of ex-Apple early engineers.
